# Tesla-Stock-Price-Prediction
A Machine Learning project to predict Tesla's stock prices using various algorithms and data analysis techniques.

# 🚗 Tesla Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses historical stock data of Tesla Inc. and applies a **linear regression model** to predict future closing prices. The goal is to explore how machine learning can provide accurate, real-time stock predictions and assist in financial decision-making.
