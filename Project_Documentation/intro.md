# ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Tesla Inc., founded in 2003, is one of the pioneering companies in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing. While Tesla has made massive strides in innovation and investor value, its stock price has shown significant volatility, raising concerns among customers and shareholders.

This project explores the impact of Tesla's stock on its vehicle market and uses machine learning techniques to predict stock price trends. By analyzing historical stock data with a linear regression model, we aim to provide insights into price behavior that can aid both consumers and investors.

Tesla's rapid growth has made it one of the most valuable companies in the S&P 500, yet it trades at unusually high valuation multiples. Understanding and forecasting its stock trends is both a financial challenge and a technological opportunity.
