# ❓ Problem Statement

Stock market prediction is a long-standing challenge due to the market’s volatile and dynamic nature. Investors, analysts, and companies seek reliable ways to forecast stock prices for better decision-making and risk management.

Traditional methods like technical and fundamental analysis have limitations when it comes to capturing nonlinear relationships in financial data. With the rise of data availability and computational power, machine learning offers a more powerful and scalable approach.

This project focuses on predicting Tesla's stock prices using historical data and linear regression techniques, aiming to improve accuracy and provide meaningful insights for stakeholders.
