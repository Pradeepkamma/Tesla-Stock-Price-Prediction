# ðŸ§  Existing System

Previous approaches to stock prediction often relied on fundamental or technical analysis, which lacked adaptability to complex patterns. Some modern systems have incorporated sentiment analysis â€” using data from social media (like tweets) to detect positive or negative public sentiment â€” and attempted to correlate it with stock movements.

In Teslaâ€™s case, research has shown a link between Elon Muskâ€™s social media activity and stock fluctuations. These methods involve natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze the emotional tone behind posts.

However, these systems face several challenges:
- High data requirements and preprocessing effort
- Limited model interpretability
- Dependency on non-structured textual data
- Computationally expensive models

While useful, sentiment-based systems often lack consistency when applied in real-time or with limited data.
