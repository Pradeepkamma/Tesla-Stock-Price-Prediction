# ðŸ’¡ Proposed System

We propose a machine learning-based approach using linear regression to predict Teslaâ€™s stock closing prices. The model takes historical data (Open, High, Low, Volume) as input features and maps them to the closing price.

Key stages of the system:
1. Data collection from reliable sources
2. Data preprocessing and normalization
3. Model training using supervised learning
4. Evaluation using metrics like MAE and RMSE
5. Visualization of predictions vs actual results

The system is designed to be simple, interpretable, and effective for analyzing real-world stock data.
